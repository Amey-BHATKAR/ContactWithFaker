The folder consists of the minimal source files showing the working of the project. It has all the controllers, models and views. 

I have used Doctrine ORM for mapping and TWIG for HTML pages.

I did this project with the the following project description.

Project Description:

Create a symfony2 standard project 
You will need to create a new bundle with 2 entities :
1. Contact: containing the name and surname

2. and Address that contains the street name number the zip code and the country.

A contact can have one or more addresses

Create the database and tables using doctrine2 

Fill the database with 1000 contacts. (via a php method using symfony or not.) 

Create a page (with url: contact/list) listing all contacts name and surnames only. for each
contact list the addresses. (zip code and country only)
No css or html is needed.
